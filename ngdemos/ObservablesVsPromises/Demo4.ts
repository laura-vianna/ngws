// Demo 4: More Observables advantages

// function that returned the promise becuase the promise has 
// already executed and cannot be repeated or retried

// If you were to call promise.then() again it won't run the code again,
// but instead it will return the same value it already had
promise.then (x => console.log(x));


let observable =  new Observable((observer) => {
    // track the id of the setTimeout
    var id = setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('Observable timeout hit')

    },1000);
    console.log("observable Started");
    
    // This will be called to tear down the observable if we cancel it
